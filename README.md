# Digital-Watch
Digital Watch I built a sleek and functional digital watch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The watch displays the current time with a gradient text effect, includes a calendar view, and features a menu toggle button for easy navigation. The design is responsive and user-friendly, perfect for both desktop and mobile devices.
